# Changelog

All notable changes to spark for Bedrock are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased][Unreleased]

### Added

- Preserve the active host identity when saving profiles recovered from a crash journal.

- Add a Windows x64 LeviLamina 26.20.x host target with a permission-gated
  `/spark` command, shared configuration, TPS/MSPT and health statistics,
  background profiling, local execution-profile saves, and clean server
  shutdown.

- Build the LeviLamina target as a single `levilamina_spark.dll` with its
  matching PDB and manifest, while retaining the existing LL host adapters and
  shared profiler services.

- Add LL-managed quiescent unload, load, reload, and reactivate for the single
  LeviLamina module, including cleanup of world and chunk subscriptions before
  physical unload.

- Expose LeviLamina native-mod metadata and aggregate player ping.

- Port the Endstone v0.11.4 world, region, and chunk metadata path to LeviLamina
  for the three vanilla dimensions, including entity-type data plus entity and
  loaded-chunk gauges, and reuse behavior-pack discovery. Tile/block-entity counts
  and gamerules remain unavailable.

### Fixed

- Complete LeviLamina cleanup during automatic server shutdown to prevent a
  process-exit crash, while retaining server-thread checks for runtime reloads.

- Avoid reporting zero world counts when a host metadata read becomes unavailable.

- Prevent completed and cancelled LeviLamina main-thread tasks from accumulating
  in dispatcher bookkeeping during long-running server sessions.
- Notify the server console and players when the crash-recovery journal degrades,
  including when a session may no longer be recoverable.

### Changed

- Reduce CPU overhead of persistent Linux allocation-rate metrics while preserving
  allocation profiler and unload behavior. Single-writer counters reduced observer
  cost by 7.3-13.3 ns/op across seven single-thread benchmark workloads, with
  unchanged reported counters and one-thread hook coverage.

### Fixed

- Exclude resolved Linux allocation-hook callback frames from execution profiles.
- Keep recovery journal size accounting accurate when retained segments disappear
  or cannot be statted, and stop journal growth after persistent metadata snapshot
  failure or stalled pruning while profiling continues.
- Prevent repeated startup replay of the same journal generation after cleanup
  fails, and retain the first degradation cause and notices across session finalization.
- Preserve world gauge counts while the level is unavailable and retry failed tile
  reconciliation after a five-second backoff.

## [0.6.1][0.6.1] - 2026-09-27

### Added

- Support Linux allocation profiling with standard shared jemalloc and mimalloc
  loaded at startup through `LD_PRELOAD`.

### Fixed

- Recognize startup-preloaded Linux allocators after Endstone clears the runtime
  `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable.
- Show the resolved Linux allocator provider in allocation profile backend metadata.

## [0.6.0][0.6.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added

- Add Java-compatible health reports and a live health dashboard with background
  uploads, rolling TPS, tick-duration, CPU, world, and ping history, and trusted
  viewer clients.
- Add an optional `spark` expansion for Endstone PlaceholderAPI with TPS,
  tick-duration, and process/system CPU placeholders. Spark continues to work
  normally when PAPI is not installed or active.
- Add one-hour process-memory history and 1m/5m/15m allocation-rate metrics on
  Windows and Linux, with `health show --memory` and `--network` detail views.
- Attribute sampled Python plugin call chains on CPython 3.12+; CPython 3.11
  remains native-only.
- Export active Bedrock behavior-pack metadata and a reviewed safe subset of
  `server.properties`, with opt-in support for additional safe keys.
- Preserve the initiating player's UUID across profiler, health, activity,
  upload, and recovery metadata.
- Allow `/spark profiler open --comment <text>` to override the comment shown in
  the live viewer.
- Report the number of ticks included by `--only-ticks-over`, and distinguish
  samples discarded from an unfinished terminal tick from other incomplete data.
- Improve Windows native symbol attribution for templates, lambdas, local
  classes, and other ambiguous compiler-generated names.
- Support Java-compatible Spark configuration environment variables.

### Changed

- Align command parsing, help visibility, profiler action precedence, umbrella
  permissions, and zero-interval defaults more closely with Java spark.
- Align live-viewer updates and profiling windows to stable global cadences, and
  use monotonic deadlines for timed profiles, uptime, ping, and network sampling
  so wall-clock changes or server stalls do not skew them.
- Distribute Linux builds as a single `endstone_spark.so`. A full server restart
  is recommended when upgrading from the old helper-based runtime or after an
  update that changes Spark's persistent native allocation support.
- **BREAKING**: Linux allocation profiling now supports allocator providers that
  are part of the server's startup dependency graph. Custom allocator providers
  loaded later at runtime are not supported.
- Improve Windows x64 allocation profiling so plugin unload does not leave native
  callbacks targeting unloaded Spark code.
- Reduce sampler/allocation aggregation overhead, profile-export allocations, and
  peak memory use during crash-recovery replay.
- Make Linux native symbol attribution more conservative by rejecting ambiguous
  evidence instead of presenting uncertain labels as resolved functions.

### Fixed

- Improve allocation-profiler cleanup and failure handling on Windows and Linux,
  including Windows stack unwinding and `LastError` preservation, Linux caller
  attribution, and bounded stop/finalize paths so slow cleanup cannot freeze the
  server indefinitely.
- Keep persistent Linux allocation support safe across plugin unload and late
  callbacks. Incompatible or exhausted process-lifetime state is reported and
  requires a full server restart.
- Make recovery-journal flushing, rotation, and module-definition ordering more
  durable, and retain recovery data when shutdown cleanup is incomplete.
- Preserve independent complete call trees for different threads that share the
  same display name.
- Export Python filename leaves and code identifiers without server-owner
  directory paths while retaining available line information.
- Strip absolute source directories from native compiler-generated lambda names
  in exported profiles while retaining the source filename and location.
- Harden live-viewer and health-dashboard connection lifecycle, reconnects,
  trusted-client validation, malformed input handling, and bounded send/receive
  queues.
- Keep viewer and health notification failures off the server tick path and ensure
  failed connections are cleaned up.
- Include players correctly in aggregate world entity gauges and include world
  metadata in the initial health report.
- Match upstream spark protocol details for profile data version, tick-threshold
  units, and tick-duration placeholder windows and percentile ranks.
- Prevent Spark's native allocation-hook internals from being charged to Spark in
  execution-profile Plugins View.
- Prevent the viewer's process-memory denominator from decoding as zero while
  preserving native RSS/committed-memory semantics.
- Skip unsafe device-metadata ping polling for unauthenticated headless BDS
  clients.
- Keep a completed allocation profile stable until serialization finishes before
  persistent allocation-rate counting resumes.
- Prevent Windows execution sampling failures from leaving the target BDS thread
  suspended.
- Preserve recovery journals when export shutdown cleanup does not complete, and
  report cleanup warnings only when cleanup actually remains incomplete.

## [0.5.3][0.5.3] - 2026-08-14

### Added

- Attribute sampled native frames to their owning Endstone C++ plugin on Windows
  and Linux using a profile-start module snapshot.
- Resolve hidden Linux plugin functions from ELF/DWARF data during profile export.

## [0.5.2][0.5.2] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- Accept `/spark profiler upload` (and `/spark sampler upload`) as a
  compatibility alias for `/spark profiler stop`, matching upstream spark.
  `--upload` and `--stop` legacy flag forms are also accepted.

### Fixed

- Harden crash recovery against corrupted, truncated, or rotation-damaged
  journals. A recovery journal missing its early segments (head-truncated by
  segment rotation), referencing module IDs whose `ModuleDef` records were
  deleted, or carrying a `CLEAN_END` marker no longer causes plugin enable to
  fail. Rolling journals now preserve session metadata in a crash-consistent
  snapshot sidecar before pruning old segments, so rotated profiles remain
  recoverable. Allocation profiles record an explicit module-0 sentinel so
  samples referencing the catch-all module resolve correctly during replay.
  Clean-end sessions skip replay entirely; incomplete or malformed journals are
  safely discarded (or quarantined on unexpected exceptions) and the server
  continues starting up normally. Previously this could abort the plugin on
  Windows (`invalid vector subscript`) or crash the entire BDS process on Linux
  via an exception crossing the plugin DSO boundary.

## [0.5.1][0.5.1] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Support continuously updating Live Viewer sessions for `--alloc` and
  `--alloc-live-only` profiles.

## [0.5.0][0.5.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added

- Automatically recover profiling data after a BDS crash or forced process
  termination. During execution and allocation profiling sessions (including the
  background profiler), samples are written to a crash-safe recovery journal under
  `plugins/spark/profiles/recovery/`. On the next startup, an unclean supported
  session is replayed into a `.sparkprofile` file under `plugins/spark/profiles/`.
  The recovery directory is cleaned after a successful save. Both Windows and
  Linux are supported.
- Detect main-thread stalls with an independent watchdog thread that monitors a
  monotonic heartbeat updated every tick. When the server thread stops ticking for
  more than 5 seconds, stall begin/end events are recorded in the recovery journal
  so that recovered profiles retain stall evidence. The watchdog never calls
  Endstone APIs and never stops the profiler.
- Add persistent Spark configuration (`config.toml` in the plugin data directory)
  with configurable `viewerUrl`, `bytebinUrl`, `bytesocksHost`, background
  profiler settings, and response broadcast toggle. Invalid config is reported and
  preserved byte-for-byte while that startup uses safe defaults. Trusted viewer
  keys are stored separately in `trusted-viewers.json`.
- Add automatic background profiler that starts on plugin enable and runs
  indefinitely at a configurable interval (default 10ms). A foreground
  profiler (`/spark profiler start`) pauses the background session; stopping
  the foreground profiler via `/spark profiler stop` restarts the background.
  Timeout and cancel do not restart the background profiler.
- Add `/spark ping` command with rolling 15-minute player ping RTT statistics
  (min/median/p95/max), `--player <name>` lookup, and profile metadata
  integration via `PlatformStatistics.Ping`.
- Add per-interface network throughput monitoring (RX/TX bytes and packets per
  second) with 15-minute rolling averages, displayed in `/spark health` and
  exported in profile metadata via `SystemStatistics.NetInterface`.
- Add `/spark health --upload` to generate and upload a spark `HealthData`
  report (platform metadata, system resources, 15-minute time-window history,
  and plugin list) to the spark viewer.
- Add `/spark activity` command with persisted activity log (profiler uploads,
  saved profiles, and health report uploads), JSON storage with atomic writes
  and corruption-safe loading, 60-day URL expiry, and `--page` pagination.
- Add `--not-combined` and `--combine-all` profiler flags to control how sampled
  threads appear in the viewer: separate roots per thread, a single merged root,
  or the default pool-based grouping.
- Preserve exact sampled native PCs and their independently validated function
  roots in forward-compatible profile fields for offline normalization metrics.
- Resolve Linux vtable labels for shared implementations by parsing Itanium RTTI
  inheritance edges, attributing virtual functions to their common ancestor class
  instead of leaving the RVA unresolved.
- Label unresolved Linux main-executable functions that reference uniquely-owned
  BDS debug trace strings (`"N _functionName"` patterns) with low-confidence
  `str?` hints.
- Label unresolved Linux main-executable functions that reference multiple unique
  weak string hints with tentative `str?` accumulated labels.
- Propagate lambda type names from `std::function::__func` vtable thunks to their
  single large unresolved call target on Linux with low-confidence `call?` hints.
- Label unresolved Linux main-executable functions with characteristic code
  patterns (Knuth multiplicative hash, 64-bit hash multiplier, atomic
  `lock cmpxchg`/`lock xadd`, binary search range-halving) with low-confidence
  `type?` behavior hints.
- Add `/spark profiler open` command to open a live, auto-updating spark
  viewer during an active execution profile. Connects to the spark WebSocket
  relay with RSA2048-signed messages and uploads sampler data every 10 seconds.
  The viewer closes automatically when the profiler stops, is cancelled, or
  times out.
- Add `/spark profiler trust-viewer --id <client id>` command to approve a
  pending live viewer client. Untrusted clients receive an UNTRUSTED connect
  response; trusted clients receive ACCEPTED and gain access to the live
  sampler data stream. Trusted public keys are persisted in `trusted-viewers.json`.
- Add command aliases matching upstream spark: `sampler` for `profiler`, `cpu`
  for `tps`, `healthreport` and `ht` for `health`, `activitylog` and `log` for
  `activity`, `tickmonitoring` for `tickmonitor`.
- Add per-command permissions (`spark.profiler`, `spark.tps`, `spark.ping`,
  `spark.health`, `spark.activity`, `spark.tickmonitor`) in addition to the
  umbrella `endstone.command.spark` permission.
- Populate per-window entity and chunk counts in profile metadata from rolling
  gauge samples, matching upstream spark's `WindowStatistics` fields.
- Group world chunk statistics into regions using 8-neighbor connected-component
  analysis, matching upstream spark's `WorldStatisticsProvider.groupIntoRegions()`
  algorithm.
- Include safe `server.properties` values (max-players, view-distance,
  tick-distance, compression settings, etc.) in profile metadata via
  `SamplerMetadata.server_configurations` using a strict whitelist that excludes
  level-seed, passcodes, and any credential-like fields.
- Pretty-print `activity.json` with 2-space indentation for readability.

### Fixed

- Format unavailable-player ping output as one correctly formatted message in
  `/spark ping`.
- Group native and recovered profiler thread labels by pool for execution and
  allocation profiles.
- Preserve pending Windows allocation events during normal profiler stop for
  later draining, while still reporting callback drops caused by contention.
- Report lost allocation lifecycle records accurately when refusing retained
  allocation profiles instead of always blaming exhausted capacity.
- Keep live viewer updates ordered across interrupted WebSocket sends and report unexpected transport closures.
- Remove expired call-tree nodes and thread roots from continuous background
  profiles instead of retaining dead topology beyond the one-hour history window.
- Serialize live snapshots with profiler lifecycle transitions so stop, cancel,
  timeout, and shutdown cannot resume an ended sampling session.
- Contain exceptions at every production worker entry and recover export/viewer
  state when dispatch or background processing fails.
- Preserve Linux signal-handler synchronization when bounded capture teardown
  cannot prove that an active handler has completed.
- Include the strict allowlisted server configuration map in health reports and
  validate configured HTTP/WebSocket endpoint syntax before applying it.
- Send a bounded WebSocket close frame during ordinary local viewer shutdown.
- Bound continuous background profile history to the upstream one-hour retention
  window while preserving complete finite foreground profiles.
- Keep live viewer metadata capture on the server thread and move relay setup,
  compression, health uploads, and profile uploads to owned background workers.
- Complete WebSocket receive-worker joins after remote disconnects and make live
  viewer open/close/reconnect safe during stop, shutdown, and network failure.
- Isolate recovery journal segments by session, validate segment continuity, retain
  journals after profile save failures, and synchronize writer teardown with the
  stall watchdog.
- Validate activity page numbers without narrowing or overflowing pagination
  arithmetic, including values above `INT_MAX`.
- Preserve invalid user-owned `config.toml` files and validate endpoint, enum,
  interval, type, and integer bounds before applying configuration.
- Validate foreground profiler options before pausing the background profiler and
  keep stop, cancel, timeout, and export transitions consistent.
- Use non-blocking allocation lifecycle shards under contention and mark exported
  allocation data incomplete whenever callback accounting is dropped.
- Isolate delayed Linux sampling signals by capture generation and wait for queued
  deliveries before restoring the process signal handler.
- Serialize process-wide Windows DbgHelp ownership so live symbolization cannot
  clean up an active capture session.
- Rebaseline network interfaces on counter reset or reappearance, use 64-bit
  Windows counters, and calculate rates from measured elapsed time.
- Enforce formatting and project-owned clang-tidy checks in CI, and publish GitHub
  releases only after both platform artifacts pass their full test suites.
- Match upstream pool grouping labels for threads whose names do not identify a
  numbered worker pool.
- Save `.sparkprofile` files as raw uncompressed protobuf instead of gzip-compressed
  data. The spark viewer's file upload expects uncompressed protobuf; gzip-wrapped
  files could not be opened when manually uploaded to spark.lucko.me. Bytebin uploads
  remain gzip-compressed as before.
- Reconstruct per-window tick statistics in crash-recovered profiles. Previously,
  recovered profiles lacked `WindowStatistics.ticks` data, causing the spark viewer's
  "Time per tick" label to display total elapsed time instead of per-tick time.
- Skip crash recovery for sessions that ended cleanly. Normal profiler stop,
  plugin unload, and BDS shutdown all write a CLEAN_END marker to the recovery
  journal; on the next startup, these journals are cleaned up without generating
  a duplicate `.sparkprofile`. Only journals without CLEAN_END (crash or forced
  termination) trigger recovery.
- Refuse recovery for allocation live-only (`--alloc-live-only`) sessions.
  The recovery journal records allocation requests but not free/realloc events,
  so retained-allocation lifecycle state cannot be reconstructed. The recovery
  player returns an error instead of producing a semantically incorrect profile.
- Stop the recovery journal writer when the profiler is shut down in allocation
  mode, preventing the writer thread from outliving the plugin during unload.
- Prevent BDS crash when running `/spark health` after ~5 minutes of uptime.
  The network interface display loop used `std::vformat` with 8 `std::string`
  arguments, which threw a non-standard exception on Linux/libc++ once network
  monitoring data became available. Replaced with direct string concatenation.
- Catch any uncaught C++ exception in command dispatch and report it as an
  error message instead of letting it propagate to `MinecraftCommands` and
  trigger `std::terminate`.
- Recover Linux function extents from validated CIE/FDE records, including
  unindexed records in a safely terminated `.eh_frame`, instead of extending
  every function to the next unwind-table start.
- Keep addresses in unwind gaps and PLT entries out of adjacent functions while
  normalizing sampled PCs inside exact half-open function ranges.
- Serialize `server.properties` metadata as a single JSON object string under the
  `"server.properties"` key in `server_configurations`, matching the upstream
  spark viewer's expected format. Previously, individual property key-value pairs
  were sent as separate map entries, which caused the spark viewer to crash with
  "An unexpected error occurred".

### Changed

- Move live viewer data serialization, gzip compression, and bytebin upload off the
  main thread onto a dedicated worker thread, eliminating 120-360 ms per-update
  stalls during `/spark profiler open`.
- Apply exponential backoff (5 s -> 15 s -> 30 s -> 60 s) to background profiler
  start retries instead of attempting every tick (20 TPS) on failure.
- Replace OpenSSL with Windows CNG/BCrypt for RSA2048 key generation,
  SHA256withRSA signing, and signature verification. Windows builds no longer
  depend on or compile OpenSSL; Linux continues to use OpenSSL.
- Implement `disableResponseBroadcast` config option: when false (default),
  result notifications are broadcast to online players with spark permission;
  when true, only the command sender receives the response.
- **BREAKING**: Include sleeping threads in execution profiles by default,
  replacing `--include-sleeping` with `--ignore-sleeping` to opt out.
- Group sampled threads by pool name by default (matching upstream spark's
  `BY_POOL` mode) instead of emitting separate per-thread viewer roots.
- Add deterministic Linux symbol-index timing, memory, range-quality, and batch
  diagnostics to profile metadata, and evaluate `Level::tick()` subtree
  readability separately from whole-process coverage.
- Replace fixed 32×32 chunk bucket grouping with 8-neighbor connected-component
  region analysis matching upstream spark's algorithm.
- Populate per-window entity and chunk counts in profile metadata instead of
  omitting those fields.

## [0.4.1][0.4.1] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- Append evidence-tagged native name guesses to unresolved main-executable frames
  on Windows and Linux while preserving the RVA. Function
  extents come from PE exception data or ELF unwind metadata, with class/slot and
  semantic hints recovered from validated RTTI, vtables, thunks, and decoded
  string references.

### Changed

- Store profiles created by `--save-to-file` or upload-failure recovery under
  `plugins/spark/profiles/` instead of the plugin data root.
- Make Linux vtable guesses deterministic and reject conflicting class owners;
  decode string references only at real x86-64 instruction boundaries and only
  for functions present in the exported profile.

## [0.4.0][0.4.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- Maintain a fixed-capacity 15-minute history of completed ticks and one-second
  process/system CPU observations even when no profiler is running.
- Calculate independent 5-second, 10-second, 1-minute, 5-minute, and 15-minute TPS
  windows plus query-time MSPT distributions and rolling CPU usage.
- Populate profile metadata and per-second Viewer windows from the shared history,
  including exact time bounds, CPU, TPS, MSPT median/max, and low-cost player counts.
- Report real rolling TPS, MSPT distributions, and process/system CPU from
  `/spark tps`, with the available history duration shown during warm-up.

### Changed

- Share one cross-platform process CPU normalization rule and keep allocation,
  sorting, and percentile work out of the per-tick statistics path.
- Omit unavailable per-second entity and chunk fields instead of copying a final
  world snapshot or serializing zero as though it were an observation.
- Make `/spark health` use the shared performance snapshot and consistently report
  available process RSS/virtual memory, threads, physical memory, swap/page-file,
  disk, uptime, players, CPU, and OS resources on Windows and Linux.
- Track resource-field availability explicitly and omit failed system/profile
  queries rather than presenting synthetic zero values.

### Fixed

- Stop copying one TPS/CPU average across every rolling field or labeling MSPT
  means and maxima as median, minimum, and p95 values in profile metadata.
- Preserve the suspended thread's top instruction address on Windows when
  `StackWalk64` cannot unwind a caller, instead of discarding the whole sample.
- Report reserved/committed process virtual address space on Windows instead of
  incorrectly labeling private commit charge as virtual memory.
- Retry Windows hook removal within the existing bounded shutdown interval when
  a concurrently starting or exiting thread temporarily rejects context capture.

## [0.3.2][0.3.2] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- Support repeatable exact-name and case-insensitive full-match regular-expression
  thread selection for native allocation profiles, including dynamically created
  threads and `--thread *`.

### Changed

- Apply allocation thread matching in the safe aggregation path while retaining
  process-wide lifecycle tracking, so cross-thread realloc/free remains correct and
  allocator hooks never resolve names or run regular expressions.
- Separate monotonic allocation-thread identities from the bounded overflow viewer
  root so filtering remains correct after thread-ID reuse and beyond 256 roots.
- Label profile-selected allocation totals separately from process-wide hook,
  observed-byte, drop, and live/freed lifecycle diagnostics.

## [0.3.1][0.3.1] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- Sample native allocations across process threads with independent byte-sampling
  state, monotonic session thread identities, stable overflow merging, and
  per-thread spark Viewer roots.
- Patch supported allocator relocations in the Linux main executable and loaded
  ELF modules, with REL/RELA validation, RELRO permission restoration, periodic
  rescans, and unload-safe cleanup.
- Export distinct allocation hook, success, sampling-point, enqueue, drop,
  queue high-water, live-index, thread, module, and truncation metadata.

### Fixed

- Avoid Windows loader-TLS recursion by keeping allocation-hook thread state in a
  preallocated native TLS registry and bypassing hooks while a thread's static TLS
  vector is being constructed.
- Preserve sampled allocation identity across cross-thread free and realloc,
  including failure, zero-size, in-place, moved, and address-reuse cases.
- Use a bounded multi-producer allocation event queue on Linux, enforce the declared
  tick-event capacity on both native backends, and shard their live-allocation
  indexes.
- Suppress allocation sampling from aggregation, module scanning, export, and
  symbolization control paths.
- Quiesce active Windows detours before restoring allocator entry points during
  shutdown, including allocations originating in other loaded DLLs.

### Limitations

- Allocation coverage does not include static or private allocators,
  `VirtualAlloc`/`VirtualFree`, `mmap`/`munmap`, or module lifetimes that begin and
  end entirely between Linux rescans.

## [0.3.0][0.3.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added

- Add `/spark tickmonitor` with percentage-over-baseline and absolute tick-duration
  thresholds for detecting intermittent server tick spikes.
- Support `/spark profiler start --thread *` execution profiles across all BDS
  process threads, with dynamic thread discovery and per-thread viewer roots.
- Support repeatable exact-name and regular-expression thread selection for
  execution profiles, with matching thread-dumper metadata in viewer payloads.
- Include the running BDS executable's SHA-256 in every profile so offline
  binary analysis can select the exact matching server build without collecting
  the executable or server-private data.

### Fixed

- Weight execution samples by each thread's measured runnable time instead of the
  nominal interval, preserving viewer time semantics for sequential multi-thread sweeps.
- Detect idle Windows threads through `QueryThreadCycleTime` deltas so the default
  execution profiler skips their suspension and stack-walk overhead.
- Schedule matching execution threads round-robin with at most one stack-walk attempt
  per interval, bounding profiler overhead as the process thread count grows.

## [0.2.0][0.2.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- `/spark profiler start --alloc` on Windows, producing an uploaded spark
  `ALLOCATION` profile weighted by sampled UCRT allocation bytes.
- `/spark profiler start --alloc` on Linux x86-64 using atomic BDS ELF import-slot
  hooks for glibc allocation entry points.
- `/spark profiler start --alloc-live-only` for retained-allocation call trees and
  leak-candidate analysis by allocation stack and age.
- Byte-based allocation stack sampling with spark's default 524287-byte interval,
  a randomized systematic sampling phase, a preallocated hook event pool,
  deferred module/symbol resolution, per-second windows, and
  `--only-ticks-over` support.
- CMake FetchContent integration for funchook v1.1.3, avoiding an unavailable
  Conan Center package.

### Changed

- Reject ambiguous export-only UCRT symbol names during Windows symbolization and
  fall back to `module+0xRVA` instead of displaying unrelated nearest exports.
- Export allocation sample count, dropped sample count, estimated sampled byte
  weight, observed request bytes, interval, backend, and coverage through spark
  `extra_platform_metadata`.
- Report every candidate allocation entry point as active, aliased, missing, or
  unhookable in profiler status and exported platform metadata.
- Follow sampled allocations through realloc and free entry points across threads,
  reporting live/freed estimates and sampled allocation lifetimes on both native
  backends.
- Preserve the process's effective Linux allocator implementation, including
  `LD_PRELOAD` interposition, while redirecting BDS import slots.
- Harden native hook lifecycle handling: prepare and retain trampolines separately
  from entry-hook installation, retain disabled entry hooks between sessions,
  stabilize and verify thread suspension, retry thread restoration, and require
  complete entry-hook removal plus hook/trampoline quiescence before plugin unload.
  An unrecoverable cleanup failure terminates the process instead of pinning old
  plugin code or permitting an unsafe reload.
- Treat the allocation aggregator as a fallible service: failures disable capture,
  block partial-profile export, remain visible through profiler status, and allow
  a clean subsequent session after stop/cancel.
- Report failed allocation sessions explicitly, discard their incomplete data on
  stop/cancel/timeout, and confirm when the backend is ready to start again.
- Write valid gzip-compressed local profiles atomically and automatically save a
  local copy when upload fails, so completed captures are not lost to the network.
- Replace the finite repeated threshold table with constant-time systematic byte
  sampling using a fresh uniformly random phase per session. Allocation weights
  use successful requested sizes and every sampling point is attributed to the
  allocation that contains it.
- Expand native coverage to recalloc, aligned allocation families, internal UCRT
  base exports, and direct `HeapAlloc`/`HeapReAlloc`, while avoiding duplicate hooks
  for alias exports.
- Encapsulate Windows allocation backend state in the `AllocationSampler` instance
  instead of file-level mutable globals.
- Removed the temporary `/spark alloc start|info|stop|reset|test` validation
  commands and their allocation/free counter implementation.
- Stop sampling before collecting plugin/world export metadata so the profiler's
  own metadata allocations are not included in allocation profiles.

### Limitations

- Direct virtual-memory calls and custom allocator activity below its backing
  Windows heap allocation are not supported.

## [0.1.1][0.1.1] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- Build Linux plugins on Ubuntu 22.04 for compatibility with older glibc hosts.
- Upload profiles without requiring an external `curl` executable.

### Changed

- Upload Linux and Windows plugin binaries from every Build workflow run.
- Support manually building a selected Git ref for release testing.
- Generate release notes and changelog entries from one normalized release section.

## [0.1.0][0.1.0] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- Preserve `--save-to-file` for the entire profiler session, including manual
  `stop` and `upload` commands.
- Populate world, region, and chunk statistics from loaded chunks and actors.

### Added

- Native statistical sampling profiler for the Bedrock Dedicated Server thread,
  covering all BDS internal calls (not just plugins), with results uploaded to the
  spark web viewer.
- `/spark profiler start|stop|info|cancel` with flags `--interval`, `--timeout`,
  `--only-ticks-over`, `--save-to-file`, `--comment`, and `--include-sleeping`.
- `/spark tps` and `/spark health`.
- Linux backend: `SIGPROF` sampler with cpptrace async-signal-safe stack capture and
  `dladdr` symbolization (module + RVA fallback for stripped frames).
- Windows backend: `SuspendThread` + `StackWalk64` capture with PDB symbolization.
